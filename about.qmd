Hi, Iâ€™m Chelsea ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m currently completing a Master of Business at **Monash University**, focusing on **data analytics** and how it can be used to understand people better and make smarter decisions. My background in psychology means I naturally think about the *human side* of data, and I love turning numbers into stories that people can actually use.  

Iâ€™m passionate about **clear communication, visualisation, and problem-solving**-- basically finding ways to make data less intimidating and more useful. Whether itâ€™s through research, HR, or business strategy, I enjoy exploring how data and people come together.  

When Iâ€™m not studying or working with data, youâ€™ll usually find me learning new tools, diving into storytelling projects, or finding creative ways to connect ideas across fields.
