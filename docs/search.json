    "text": "Hi, I’m Chelsea 👋\nI’m currently completing a Master of Business at Monash University, focusing on data analytics and how it can be used to understand people better and make smarter decisions. My background in psychology means I naturally think about the human side of data, and I love turning numbers into stories that people can actually use.\nI’m passionate about clear communication, visualisation, and problem-solving– basically finding ways to make data less intimidating and more useful. Whether it’s through research, HR, or business strategy, I enjoy exploring how data and people come together.\nWhen I’m not studying or working with data, you’ll usually find me learning new tools, diving into storytelling projects, or finding creative ways to connect ideas across fields."

    "text": "When COVID-19 border quarantine systems were first set up, they worked pretty well at keeping outbreaks out of countries like Australia and New Zealand. But the arrival of the Delta variant changed the equation. Delta spread much faster, and vaccines weren’t as effective at stopping transmission. The big question was:\n👉 Could vaccination alone replace strict quarantine, or did we still need tough border rules?"

    "text": "What Data & Models Were Used\nThe study I reviewed (Zachreson et al., 2022) combined:\n\nQuarantine facility models tracking travelers, workers, testing, and possible “breach events” (when infection escaped quarantine).\n\nCommunity outbreak models that simulated how breaches could spread under different conditions– vaccine effectiveness, coverage rates, and viral transmissibility.\n\nThe researchers used real-world data on infection rates in travelers, incubation periods, test sensitivity, and Delta’s transmissibility."

    "text": "Key findings\n\nFigure: Vaccines vs transmissibility\nHere’s a simplified version of one of the study’s results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Outbreak risk depends on both vaccine efficacy and transmissibility. Higher transmissibility (R0) requires more effective vaccines to keep risks under control.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that for mild strains (R₀ ≈ 3), vaccines weren’t strictly necessary.\nBut for Delta (R₀ ≈ 6), vaccines needed to be at least 60% effective to keep outbreak risks at baseline.\nFor even more transmissible strains (R₀ ≈ 8), they had to be above 70%."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe results are clear:\n🟢 Vaccination helps a lot, but quarantine remains necessary for highly transmissible variants.\nEven if all travelers and staff were vaccinated, breaches still occurred. Without strong quarantine, outbreaks followed quickly — and if the community wasn’t highly vaccinated, spread was much faster. Instead of treating vaccines vs. quarantine as a trade-off, policymakers should treat them as complementary strategies: vaccines reduce infection risk, while quarantine reduces the chance of importation. These findings align with Zachreson et al. (2022), who concluded that vaccine coverage alone could not fully replace strict border quarantine during the Delta wave."
